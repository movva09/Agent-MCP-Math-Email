## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install python-dotenv google-generativeai mcp google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client
   ```
3. Set up your environment variables as described above
4. Set up Gmail API credentials:
   - Go to Google Cloud Console
   - Create a new project
   - Enable Gmail API
   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
   - Download the credentials file

## Usage
1. Start the MCP server (see Server Setup section)
2. Ensure the server is running and accessible
3. Run the client:
   ```bash
   python talk2mcp_math_gmail_client.py
   ```

## Server-Client Communication
1. Connection Protocol:
   - Client establishes connection with server
   - Authentication handshake
   - Tool list synchronization
   - Session initialization
   - Email service verification

2. Data Flow:
   - Client sends mathematical queries
   - Server processes requests
   - Results are formatted for email
   - Email queue is managed
   - Delivery status is tracked
   - Notifications are sent

3. Error Handling:
   - Connection retry mechanism
   - Session recovery
   - Email queue recovery
   - Rate limit handling
   - Resource cleanup

## Example Queries
1. Basic Mathematical Email:
```
Calculate the factorial of 10 and send the result to user@example.com with the subject "Factorial Calculation Result".
```

2. Complex Mathematical Analysis:
```
Find the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, calculate their sum, and send the detailed analysis to team@example.com with a graph attachment.
```

3. Multiple Operations with Formatting:
```
Calculate the roots of the quadratic equation xÂ² + 5x + 6 = 0, format the solution in LaTeX, and send it to professor@example.com with proper mathematical notation.
```

4. Scheduled Mathematical Report:
```
Generate a report of prime numbers between 1 and 1000, create a histogram of their distribution, and schedule it to be sent to research@example.com tomorrow at 9:00 AM.
```

## How It Works
1. The client connects to the MCP server
2. It processes mathematical queries using the Gemini AI model
3. Results are formatted for email
4. The system uses an iterative approach to solve complex problems
5. Results are sent via Gmail to specified recipients

## Error Handling
The client includes robust error handling for:
- API timeouts
- Invalid inputs
- Connection issues
- Tool execution errors
- Gmail authentication and sending errors

## Security
- Uses OAuth 2.0 for Gmail authentication
- Secure storage of API keys and credentials
- Encrypted communication with Gmail API
